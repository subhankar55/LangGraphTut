Unstructured recently integrated the object detection capabilities of IBM Research’s Docling in order to accomplish this objective, increasing overall accuracy.\\n\\nNext comes agentic parsing. Think of it as a team of domain experts—only they’re AI agents—continuously scanning your corpus, building deep semantic profiles and indexing everything across a multidimensional graph. “This provides search that can operate across intent, structure, content and metadata simultaneously and makes previously inaccessible internal knowledge available in real time,” Raymond said. [...] After much skepticism around AI’s ROI, AI capabilities will pave new ways to do business in the enterprise. And open-source reasoning models and agents will keep pushing boundaries to conquer enterprise AI.\\n\\nAt the same time, trust and security will become key priorities as many enterprises sharpen their focus on AI sovereignty.\\n\\nThat’s just the opening act for what’s to come in enterprise tech in the days ahead.

[...] Generative models need to be multisensory so they can interpret the world like humans and even detect signals we might miss, said Aaron Baughman, IBM Fellow and Master Inventor, in a recent episode of Mixture of Experts.\\n\\nBaughman has worked with multimodal AI in sports and leads some of IBM’s work with the US Open, ESPN Fantasy Football and the Masters, notably. For him, multimodal AI is a trend he expects to see more of in 2026.\\n\\n“These models will be able to perceive and act in a world much more like a human. They’ll be able to bridge language, vision and action, all together,” he said. “In the near future, we’re to start seeing these multimodal digital workers that can autonomously complete these different tasks to interpret things, maybe even like complex healthcare cases.” [...] “The result is a flexible reconstruction layer that synthesizes a precise representation of the original source while maintaining strong guarantees about structure, lineage and meaning,” Raymond said. Unstructured recently integrated the object detection capabilities of IBM Research’s Docling in order to accomplish this objective, increasing overall accuracy.\\n\\nNext comes agentic parsing. Think of it as a team of domain experts—only they’re AI agents—continuously scanning your corpus, building deep semantic profiles and indexing everything across a multidimensional graph. “This provides search that can operate across intent, structure, content and metadata simultaneously and makes previously inaccessible internal knowledge available in real time,” Raymond said.\", \"score\": 0.63179934}]\n",
