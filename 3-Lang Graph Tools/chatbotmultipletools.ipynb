Unstructured recently integrated the object detection capabilities of IBM Research’s Docling in order to accomplish this objective, increasing overall accuracy.\\n\\nNext comes agentic parsing. Think of it as a team of domain experts—only they’re AI agents—continuously scanning your corpus, building deep semantic profiles and indexing everything across a multidimensional graph. “This provides search that can operate across intent, structure, content and metadata simultaneously and makes previously inaccessible internal knowledge available in real time,” Raymond said. [...] After much skepticism around AI’s ROI, AI capabilities will pave new ways to do business in the enterprise. And open-source reasoning models and agents will keep pushing boundaries to conquer enterprise AI.\\n\\nAt the same time, trust and security will become key priorities as many enterprises sharpen their focus on AI sovereignty.\\n\\nThat’s just the opening act for what’s to come in enterprise tech in the days ahead.
